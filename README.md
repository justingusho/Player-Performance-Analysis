# Player-Performance-Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This mini-project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the performance of a fictional football player. The project was created purely for learning and fun purposes, focusing on data modeling, relationships, and interactive visual analytics in Power BI.

All data used in this project was manually created by me in Excel and does not represent any real player or real-world statistics.


The dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the player’s performance across multiple dimensions. Users can dynamically analyze how the player performs under different conditions using slicers and filters.

Key Features:

- Clear KPIs and visual breakdowns to compare performance trends

- Interactive filters to quickly drill down into specific scenarios
